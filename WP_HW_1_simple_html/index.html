                <div>Airsoft is a sport where you use airsoft guns, formally called <em>replicas</em> because of woke people,
                    to shoot at your opponents.
                    The <em>replicas</em> are made to look like real guns, but they shoot plastic BBs instead of bullets.

                    They can be powered by batteries, gas, or springs.<br>
                    Some are even powered by compressed air canisters strapped to your back.<br>
                    The guns are usually made of plastic, but some more expensive are made of metal, for realism.<br>
                    Most are made to resemble real firearms, although some original designs exist.

                        They are easy to distinguish from real guns, as they sound like toys.<br>

                    and even competitions. Sometimes they even give you a patch like this:
